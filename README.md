# 💫 About Me:
ICT Student at JAMK University of Applied Sciences | C#, JavaScript, Python, SQL | Tech Enthusiast

Software Developer | ICT Engineering Student at JAMK

I am a solution-oriented Software Developer and future ICT Engineer with a passion for building functional, user-centric applications. In January 2026, I started pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering at JAMK University of Applied Sciences.

My technical background is built on a foundation of practical projects and a dual qualification (vocational and high school) from Gradia. I thrive in solving complex problems and staying calm in stressful situations.

Key Technical Experience:
- Web Development: Developed a syntax-generating web tool for Gradia to automate the creation of Moodle exam questions.
- Full-Stack Projects: Updated company websites and built a reservation calendar system for EXEN Esports.
- Digital Support: Served as a Digital Tutor, providing technical guidance and troubleshooting for users.

Beyond coding, I bring strong leadership and teamwork skills gained through my Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) training in the Finnish Defence Forces and my long-term involvement as a youth leader and scout group leader. I am a proactive learner who enjoys mastering new things — especially exploring fresh technologies and deep-diving into technical challenges.
